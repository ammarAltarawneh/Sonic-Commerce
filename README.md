## Backend

### Architecture

Our backend is organized into three layers:

1. **Presentation Layer (PL):** Handles user interactions and communicates with the frontend.

2. **Business Access Layer (BAL):** Contains business logic and interacts with the Data Access Layer.

3. **Data Access Layer (DAL):** Interacts with the database using Dapper ORM and incorporates JWT for authentication and authorization.

### Technologies Used

- **Dapper ORM:** Simplifies data access in the DAL.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Ensures secure authentication and authorization.

## Frontend

### Angular Implementation

Built with Angular, our frontend features five screens for a seamless user experience.
